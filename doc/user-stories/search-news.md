## As a logged-in user, I want search for specific news story
The user is finding specific news stories that they are interested in, based on specific key words they have entered into the search function. If none of the keywords match any article, a message that “no articles have been found” will be displayed. If articles are found, a list of articles will appear for the user to choose from. If the user is not authenticated via Facebook, when s/he clicks on the article, the authenticating via Facebook user story will be prompted. If the user is authenticated, then they will be able to read the article and use other features. 
1. The user accesses the home page
2. The user will be able to click on the search bar located at the top of the home page
3. The search bar will prompt the user to search any specific keywords they will want to find in their article
4. A list will appear showing articles related to their specific keywords
5. The user clicks on the article they want to read
    1. If not logged on, the user will go through the “Authenticating via Facebook” story
6. A window will appear showing the article
7. The user clicks outside of the article to return to the globe

Note this function was not added into the application due to a bottleneck of how often we could make calls to the dandelion api
